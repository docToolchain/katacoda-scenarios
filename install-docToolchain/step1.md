First you have to install SDKMAN!.
If you work on your own environment and already have it installed, you can skip this step.

This step assumes that you have `curl` and `unzip` installed on your machine.

The following command will install SDKMAN!
Please copy it over to the terminal and execute it.

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
curl -s "https://get.sdkman.io" | bash
</pre>

After a short moment, you will see that is has been installed.
In order to stay in the same terminal, you still need to execute

<pre class="file" data-target="clipboard">
source "/root/.sdkman/bin/sdkman-init.sh"
</pre>

in order to initialize it in this terminal. 
When you start a new terminal, it will be already initialized.
